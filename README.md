# unicorne
a rehash of foostan's corne, but only with 1u keys. A uniform corne.

I'm not sure if it's worth doing, but I always felt that there should be a corne version where the 1.5u thumb keys are replaced with 1u keys.
This would make it a more easily sourceable keyboard and you don't really need 1.5u keys anyway.

# WARNING
Right now the project is still at the prototype stage. I haven't confirmed PCB viability.
Additionally, the project structure is wacky since I simply copypasted foostan's crkbd repo and removed most of what I didn't need to start modding the kicad files.
